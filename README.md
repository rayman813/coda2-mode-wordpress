Coda 2 - Wordpress Syntax Mode
==================================

**UPDATE (October 24, 2014): Now compatible for Wordpress 4.x**

This repository contains a custom syntax mode for Wordpress in Coda 2. The mode includes the following:
* HTML/PHP syntax highlighting
* Wordpress code completion

Installation
------------
**To install this mode automatically** simply download the files, unzip them and open the .mode file with Coda 2.

**To install this mode manually** you must navigate to the Coda 2 install directory and copy the .mode file into the Modes folder.

Open Terminal and run the following command:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda\ 2/

Then, to open the directory in Finder enter this command:

    open .

When Finder opens, you will see multiple folders. Drag WordPress.mode into the Modes folder. 

How to Use
----------

* To use the syntax mode you must first open or create a .php file. 
* You must then set the syntax mode to Wordpress by clicking the gear icon in the lower left hand corner of Coda. *NOTE:* If you are not seeing the Wordpress syntax mode you may need to restart Coda. 
* Now you will need to open a PHP tag - `<?php` 
* Once you are inside of the PHP syntax mode you will start seeing the code completion dropdown - try opening a function starting with "get_" and you should see a long list of completion hints.
